The ServerSync tool directly depends on several thrid-party libraries

- [ByteSize](https://github.com/omar/ByteSize)
- [Microscope](http://github.com/clotheshorse/microscope)
- [NLog](https://github.com/NLog)
- [Microsoft Immutable Collections](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bclteam/p/immutable.aspx)


Furthermore documentation which is authored in Markdown is automatically transformed to HTML during build using [pretzel](https://github.com/Code52/pretzel). The HTML layout for the documentation files uses the CSS from [MarkdownPad's GitHub stylesheet](https://github.com/nicolashery/markdownpad-github)
