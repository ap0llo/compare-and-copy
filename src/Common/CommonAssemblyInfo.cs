/*
 * Versioning Guidance: 
 * 
 *   - Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.BUILD
 *   
 *   - Use semantic versioning for MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
 *   - Increment Major version for breaking changes,
 *   - Increment Minor version for backwards-compatible addition of features.
 *   - For bug-fixes increment Patch-Number
 *  
 *   - Build-Number other than zero indicates a development build based of the version MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
 *   - Increment Build-Number with at least with every checkin. 
 *   - Reset Build-Number to 0 when releasing a new version (which means incrementing either Major, Minor or Patch numbers) 
 *
